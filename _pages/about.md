Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am an Assistant Professor of Digital History & AI at the University of Amsterdam. I'm a historian of modern visual (news) culture. Most of my work is located at the intersection of media history, media studies, and digital humanities. I apply digital methods to study large collections of historical illustrations, photographs and other images.
