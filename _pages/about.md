I am a scholar of modern visual (news) culture. My work is located at the intersection of the (digital) humanities (history, memory- and visual culture studies) and social sciences (media- and social movement studies). It has been published in top-ranking journals and recognized with travel grants, invited lectures, fellowships, and a book prize for my first monograph. Fascinated by the increasingly visual nature of modern societies, I pioneered the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyse large collections of historical digitized images. Convinced of the benefits of interdisciplinary exchange, I used critical insights from the SSH to further the development of culturally-responsive AI.
