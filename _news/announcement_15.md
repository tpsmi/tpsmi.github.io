ðŸš€ Excited to share that our article 'Stochastic Remembering and Distributed Mnemonic Agency ' was just published in <i>Memory Studies Review</i>

Together with Rik Smit and Samuel Merrill, I explore how AI chatbots like ChatGPT are reshaping our relationship with historical memory. Rather than just being neutral tools, these systems introduce what we call "stochastic remembering" - a probabilistic approach to recalling the past based on their training data.
This raises crucial questions: How do AI systems influence which historical narratives become dominant? What happens when our collective memory becomes increasingly mediated through these probabilistic systems?
The implications are significant for memory studies scholars, historians, and anyone interested in how we preserve and access our shared history. As we continue to integrate AI into our knowledge systems, understanding this human-AI partnership in remembering becomes crucial.

For those interested in the intersection of AI and collective memory, the full paper delves deeper into how instruction-tuned text generators affect our process of remembering.
