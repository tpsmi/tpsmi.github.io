📖 A huge honor to have contributed a chapter to 𝘋𝘺𝘯𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘤𝘴, 𝘔𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, 𝘔𝘰𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯: The Liber Amicorum for my former postdoc supervisor Ann Rigney (edited by Astrid Erll, Susanne Knittel, and Jenny Wüstenberg).

Although we work on different subjects, Ann is a true academic role model: hard-working, (self-)critical, fair, and always innovative. The impressive collection of 54 chapters in the book reflects her profound influence and legacy across hashtag#MemoryStudies.

My chapter explores how AI-generated images (diffusion models) are reshaping our visual memory of the past. Specifically, it examines how generative AI influences the memory 𝘰𝘧 and 𝘪𝘯 social movements
