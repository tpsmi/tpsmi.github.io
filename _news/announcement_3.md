The Research Society for Victorian Periodicals awarded the 2023 Field Development Grant to our project ‘Multimodal AI, Image Analysis, and the Illustrated Periodical Press. ’

We will apply state-of-the-art multimodal machine learning to explore the illustrated world(s) of the nineteenth-century press!

Excited to work on this project with Paul Fyfe, Ben Lee, and Julia Thomas!
